# TicTacToe
Networked tic-tac-toe game using TCP and sockets

In this work, the game of tic-tac-toe over the network is implemented. 
The game interface was created using Windows Forms in the C # language. 
Data between players is transmitted via TCP using sockets. 
Players have to connect to the same local network using Hamachi, one of them starts the server, and then both of them start the game.
